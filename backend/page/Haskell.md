# Haskell

- [Our approach at work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJuXDIUMA0): I work for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.systems/) and we use Haskell. In this talk Ryan, one of Obsidian's founders, explains the rationale for choosing Haskell and goes into bit about how we work, finally announcing our new open source project [obelisk](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk). This talk as well reflects my motivations behind choosing to use Haskell.
