# Welcome!

This website is work in progress. Meanwhile you may [look at my resume](https://stackoverflow.com/story/sridca) or [look at the source code](https://github.com/srid/revue) for this site. Here's some Haskell:

```haskell
import System
frontend :: (StaticWidget x (), Widget x ())
frontend = (head', body)
  where
    head' = el "title" $ text "Hello"
    body = do
      el "h1" $ text "Hello"
      el "p" $ text "Work in progress"
```
